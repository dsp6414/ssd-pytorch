# SSD in a single pytorch file

The data loader and augmentation are directly copied from [**Max deGroot**](https://github.com/amdegroot).

The SSD model is implemented in one file: ssd.py.

My result on VOC Dataset: mAP=0.7635

## Datasets
To make things easy, we provide bash scripts to handle the dataset downloads and setup for you.  We also provide simple dataset loaders that inherit `torch.utils.data.Dataset`, making them fully compatible with the `torchvision.datasets` [API](http://pytorch.org/docs/torchvision/datasets.html).


### COCO
Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context

##### Download COCO 2014
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/COCO2014.sh
```

### VOC Dataset
PASCAL VOC: Visual Object Classes

##### Download VOC2007 trainval & test
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/VOC2007.sh # <directory>
```

## Training SSD
- First download the fc-reduced [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) PyTorch base network weights at:              https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
- By default, we assume you have downloaded the file in the `ssd.pytorch/weights` dir:

```Shell
mkdir weights
cd weights
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
```

- To train SSD using the train script simply specify the parameters listed in `train.py` as a flag or manually change them.

```Shell
python train.py
```

- Note:
  * For training, an NVIDIA GPU is strongly recommended for speed.
  * You can pick-up training from a checkpoint by specifying the path as one of the training parameters (again, see `train.py` for options)

## Evaluation
To evaluate a trained network:

```Shell
python eval.py
```
